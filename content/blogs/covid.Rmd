Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn't work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()

```

**Our file contains 4.48m rows, which means that the data might have been updated and it is the reason, why we do not get the identical figures with the sample chart**

Given the data we have, we produce two graphs that show death % rate:

- by age group, sex, and whether the patient had comorbidities or not

```{r, fig.width = 12, dpi = 180}

covid_comod <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(medcond_yn == "Yes" | medcond_yn == "No") %>% 
  filter(death_yn == "Yes" | death_yn == "No") %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male" | sex == "Female") %>%
  filter(age_group != "Unknown", age_group != "Missing", !is.na(age_group)) %>% 
  # filter(race_and_ethnicity_combined != "Unknown", !is.na(race_and_ethnicity_combined)) %>%
  group_by(sex, age_group, medcond_yn)  %>%
  summarise(prop = count(death_yn == "Yes")/n()) %>% 
  mutate(medcond_yn = case_when(
           medcond_yn == "Yes" ~ "With comorbidities",
           medcond_yn == "No" ~ "Without comorbidities"
         )) %>%
  mutate(prop = round(prop*100, 1))


ggplot(covid_comod, aes(x = prop, y = age_group)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#6f7ba2", alpha = 0.9) +
  facet_grid(medcond_yn ~ sex) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "",
       caption = "Source: CDC") +
  geom_text(aes(label = prop, x = prop + 3)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(prop) paste0(prop, "%"))

```


- by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r, fig.width = 12, dpi = 180}

covid_icu <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(icu_yn == "Yes" | icu_yn == "No",
         death_yn == "Yes" | death_yn == "No"
         ) %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male" | sex == "Female") %>% 
  filter(age_group != "Unknown", !is.na(age_group)) %>% 
  filter(race_and_ethnicity_combined != "Unknown", !is.na(race_and_ethnicity_combined)) %>%
  group_by(sex, icu_yn, age_group, death_yn) %>% 
  summarize(ttl = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = ttl/sum(ttl),
         icu_yn = case_when(
           icu_yn == "Yes" ~ "Admitted to ICU",
           icu_yn == "No" ~ "No ICU"
         )) %>% 
  filter(death_yn == "Yes") %>% 
  mutate(prop = round(prop*100, 1))

ggplot(covid_icu, aes(x = prop, y = age_group)) +
  geom_col(fill = "salmon", alpha = 0.85) +
  facet_grid(icu_yn ~ sex) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Covid death % by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU",
       x = "",
       y = "",
       caption = "Source: CDC") +
  geom_text(aes(label = prop, x = prop + 3)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(prop) paste0(prop, "%"))

```
