<h2>Twitter usage by education level</h2>
<p>Can we estimate the <em>population</em> proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?</p>
<p>Yes, statistically it is viable to extrapolate a population (split) of users from a sufficiently large sample set. There are requirements that have to be met for this to work, such as non-overlapping confidence intervals, but generally it is possible to estimate the population. In the same way that election polls do not ask the whole country but just a very small group of people, these techniques can be applied to other measures.
Below you can find a code for mean point estimation on the given sample:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gss &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;smallgss2016.csv&quot;), 
                na = c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;Don&#39;t know&quot;,
                       &quot;No answer&quot;, &quot;Not applicable&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>gss &lt;- gss %&gt;% 
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, levels = c(&quot;Lt high school&quot;, &quot;High school&quot;, &quot;Junior college&quot;, &quot;Bachelor&quot;, &quot;Graduate&quot;), ordered = TRUE))

gss %&gt;% 
  filter(degree != &quot;NA&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(twitter != &quot;NA&quot;) %&gt;% 
  group_by(degree) %&gt;% 
  summarize(prop_deg = sum(twitter == &quot;Yes&quot;)/n())</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 5 x 2
##   degree         prop_deg
##   &lt;ord&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Lt high school    0.140
## 2 High school       0.163
## 3 Junior college    0.155
## 4 Bachelor          0.229
## 5 Graduate          0.239</code></pre>
<p>There are 5 education levels in variable <code>degree</code> which, in ascending order of years of education, are Lt high school, High school, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn <code>degree</code> from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>gss &lt;- gss %&gt;% 
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, levels = c(&quot;Lt high school&quot;, &quot;High school&quot;, &quot;Junior college&quot;, &quot;Bachelor&quot;, &quot;Graduate&quot;), ordered = TRUE))</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Create a new variable, <code>bachelor_graduate</code> that is <em>Yes</em> if the respondent has either a <code>Bachelor</code> or <code>Graduate</code> degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>gss &lt;- gss %&gt;% 
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree == &quot;Bachelor&quot; | degree == &quot;Graduate&quot; ~ &quot;Yes&quot;,
    degree == &quot;NA&quot; ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ &quot;No&quot;
  ))</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Calculate the proportion of <code>bachelor_graduate</code> who do (Yes) and who don’t (No) use twitter.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>tw_total &lt;- gss %&gt;% 
  filter(twitter != &quot;NA&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == &quot;Yes&quot;) %&gt;%
  count()

tw_yes &lt;- gss %&gt;% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == &quot;Yes&quot;, twitter == &quot;Yes&quot;) %&gt;% 
  count()

prop_yes &lt;- (tw_yes/tw_total*100)
prop_no &lt;- (1-tw_yes/tw_total)*100

paste0(&quot;The proportion of Bachelors and Graduates using Twitter is &quot;, round(prop_yes, 2), &quot;%&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;The proportion of Bachelors and Graduates using Twitter is 23.31%&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>paste0(&quot;The proportion of Bachelors and Graduates not using Twitter is &quot;, round(prop_no, 2), &quot;%&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;The proportion of Bachelors and Graduates not using Twitter is 76.69%&quot;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Using the CI formula for proportions, we construct two 95% CIs for <code>bachelor_graduate</code> vs whether they use (Yes) and don’t (No) use twitter.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>yes_ci &lt;- BinomCI(as.integer(tw_yes), as.integer(tw_total), conf.level = 0.95)

no_ci &lt;- BinomCI(as.integer(tw_total - tw_yes), as.integer(tw_total), conf.level = 0.95)

paste0(&quot;95% CI for usage of Twitter among Bachelors and Graduates is between &quot;, round(yes_ci[2],2), &quot; and &quot;,
       round(yes_ci[3],2))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;95% CI for usage of Twitter among Bachelors and Graduates is between 0.2 and 0.27&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>paste0(&quot;95% CI for Bachelors and Graduates proportion not using Twitter is between &quot;, round(no_ci[2],2), &quot; and &quot;,
       round(no_ci[3],2))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;95% CI for Bachelors and Graduates proportion not using Twitter is between 0.73 and 0.8&quot;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?</li>
</ul>
<p>No, as estimated values are significantly different (if the proportion of users was around 0.5 there would be a higher chance of overlap) and the sample size is large (making the CIs quite narrow), there is no overlap.</p>
